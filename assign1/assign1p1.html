  <p>
    Steve Harrington is a fictional character from the Netflix television 
    show Stranger Things, portrayed by Joe Keery. While starting out as a 
    typical unlikable jock, Steve has grown into a more protecting and caring 
    character as the show has progressed, a development that has received 
    widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike and has led to him 
    becoming one of the show's most beloved and enduring characters. 
    Initially a part of the recurring cast, Keery was promoted to the main 
    cast in the second season. Steve is a side antagonist turned protagonist 
    at the end of season 1, and one of the main protagonists of season 2, 
    season 3, and season 4.

  <h2>Fictional character biography</h2>
  
  <h3>Season 1</h3>
  <p>
    Steve is initially portrayed as a stereotypical 1980s popular jock, 
    antagonistic and unlikable. Steve had been dating Nancy Wheeler but 
    after he harasses Jonathan Byers by breaking his camera, Nancy seems 
    to become close to Jonathan. Steve accosts Jonathan, but Jonathan 
    beats him in a fight and Steve sees the error of his ways and ignores 
    his former "friends". Traveling to the Byers' home to apologize, he 
    becomes involved in Nancy and Jonathan's fight against the 
    Demogorgon, which they defeat. At the conclusion of the season, 
    Nancy buys Jonathan a new camera and Steve continues his 
    relationship with Nancy.

  <h3>Season 2</h3>
  <p>
    Steve's relationship with Nancy is stressed, and he breaks up with 
    her after she will not say she loves him. He calls her out after her 
    drunken tirade at a party where she calls their relationship fake. 
    Steve also finds himself at odds with Billy Hargrove, a new student 
    at the school who seeks to become its tough guy. Steve becomes 
    involved with Mike Wheeler and his friends after Dustin asks him to 
    help find his "pet" D'Artagnan, unaware it is a Demodog. Steve and 
    Dustin bond over how to talk to girls, and soon Steve also takes 
    Mike, Lucas, and Max (Billy's step-sister) under his wing. Steve 
    protects the children as Demodogs start ravaging across Hawkins, 
    giving time for Eleven and Jim Hopper to close the gate to the 
    Upside Down, and for Will Byers to have the Mind Flayer exorcised 
    from his body. He also defends the kids against Billy, and is 
    knocked unconscious before Max is able to disable her brother.
